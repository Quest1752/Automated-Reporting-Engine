# Automated PPT Report Generator

This project automates the generation of PowerPoint reports using data retrieved from a database.  
It fetches relevant metrics, processes them, and dynamically updates a presentation file with the most up-to-date information.

## How It Works
- Pulls data from a database based on a selected device UUID and date range.  
- Processes the data using **pandas** and **plotly** for analysis and visualization.  
- Exports plots as images and inserts them into PowerPoint slides.  
- Updates placeholders and tables within a presentation automatically.
